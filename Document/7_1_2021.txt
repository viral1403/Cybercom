learned to switch head between branches when HEAD is located at some File rather than 
origin using "git checkout -b  <branch Name>" it can transfer us to the origin and 
branch, if only want to tranfer head to branch can use  "git switch <branch-name>" .

learned the difference between git rebase which does not commit and update the HEAD
and  merge commit which updates HEAD and commits.

The use of Stash which is used for reverting any file which is unnecessary.

studied some of the common commands using git help.

started watching the videos on Javascript Session.
