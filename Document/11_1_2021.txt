Learned different type of input types select,file,password,text,reset,radio and textarea tag.

difference between a <btn> and <input type="submit"> tag as submit directly redirects to 
the get/post method but the btn redirects to particular defined function on the <btn> tag.

Found that the standard password masking symbol is '*'/'.' for different browser
and it cannot be changed if want we can create a text password field but it may
 be less secure.

the other videos.
